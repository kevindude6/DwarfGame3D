**Bradgame: The Game**
This is the first time I've posted here. Eventually, I'd like this to be an open world voxel based RPG, but for now I'm starting with a dwarf fortress clone. This past week I've added collision detection for entities and threaded pathfinding so the game doesn't freeze whenever things move.

Not really a huge amount of playable-ness, but it's getting there. I spent a long time optimizing the engine, and it still needs a lot of work. 

Bonus: I like the idea of making old games playable on modern hardware, but I haven't bought any remasters of any game yet.
